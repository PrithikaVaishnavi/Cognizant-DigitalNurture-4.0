Project: EcommerceSearchFunction

This Java project demonstrates two search techniques:
- Linear Search (by Product Name)
- Binary Search (by Product ID, on sorted array)

Big O Analysis:
- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n)

Binary Search is more suitable for large-scale e-commerce platforms where product IDs are sorted and fast performance is required.
