Assignment: Financial Forecasting Tool

This project demonstrates a recursive approach to financial forecasting based on compound growth.

Included:
- Recursive method for predicting future value
- Memoized optimization to prevent redundant computation
- Time complexity analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursive stack or memoization map

Example:
Initial: $1000, Growth Rate: 10%, Years: 5
Result: $1610.51
